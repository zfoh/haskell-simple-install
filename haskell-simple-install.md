# ZuriHac 2020 Haskell install instructions

This guide that aims to be a simple way to get a modern Haskell toolchain up and running on your computer.

We describe only _"one way to do it"_, in order to simplify the process for beginners. The goal is to get started **fast** and make it **pleasant** to learn the language we all love.

Of course there are other ways you can do set up a Haskell dev environment, so if you already have some experience setting up your favourite build system and editor plugins then this guide might not be for you.

At the end we will have the following:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** with a plugin that gives you all the modern conveniences, like:
  - type signatures and documentation on hover.
  - autocomplete.
  - jump to definition, rename variable and function names, etc.
- **ghc** - the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
- **ghci**, a REPL to interactively type in code and explore.
- **ghcid** for monitoring your code for changes and automatically recompiling, giving you blazing fast feedback and error messages.
- **ghcide** for the IDE features in VSCode mentioned above.
- **cabal** to manage dependencies and build your project.
- (tbd: ghcup?)

If you already have some programming experience, then developing Haskell will feel slightly different, because the better compiler guarantees give us a different approach to getting fast feedback on what our code does.

For example it's not common to litter our code with `print` statements, or set breakpoints, like you might do in other languages.

But rest assured, the modern Haskell IDE experience has gotten extremly nice!


## prerequisites

## Linux

## MacOS

## Windows

### Minimal setup

This was tested on Windows 10.

- Install the Haskell Platform from https://www.haskell.org/platform/#windows
- See if your installation worked by either launching GHCi. That's your interactive prompt.
- To run single Haskell Source (.hs) files you can use `runghc` from the commandline.

Try it out with the following hello world program:

```
module Hello where

main = putStrLn "sup"
```

Save it as `Hello.hs` somewhere, and execute `runghc Hello.hs` in the commandline.

> We recommend you use **Powershell** when you need to execute stuff in the commandline. If that's not included in your version of Windows, then you can use the normal **Command Prompt** (`cmd.exe`) as well.

### More features setup

This allows you to set up projects with multiple source code files, external library dependencies, editor integration, etc.

#### 1

- Install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Launch VScode, and install the **Haskell Syntax Highlighting** plugin. Open `Hello.hs` from before and admire the shiny colours.

#### 2

Next we install the latest version of Cabal. Right now the Haskell Platform uses 2.4.1.0. That's fine, but Cabal 3 has some major improvements, so let's upgrade:

- Download the binary for your type of machine (32 or 64 bit) https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html
- Copy the cabal executable inside the .zip to `C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\8.6.5\lib\extralibs\bin`.
- Verify that you have the right version with `cabal --version`. Only  continue if this shows version 3.
- Execute `cabal update` to refresh its package index.
- Execute `cabal user-config update` to upgrade the version of Cabal's config file.

The last command also tells you _where_ the config is. I strongly suggest you open it and add the following line:

```
write-ghc-environment-files: never
```

Later, for compiling some packages like `network`, this config file also needs to be fixed, in particular the lines `extra-lib-dirs`, `extra-prog-path`, etc. See the remarks below.

You can now create new projects with `cabal init` ðŸŽ‰

#### 3

Final step: modern editor integration. The best way to do this in 2020 is to install ghcide:

```
cabal install ghcide --install-method=copy --overwrite-policy=always
```

This will compile for quite a while, so go get a coffee or make a new friend.

At the end you will have a new executable/command called `ghcid`.

For your information, the executables are "installed" in `C:\Users\your-username-here\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin`, which the installation of Haskell Platform made sure to put in your Windows `%PATH%`

Create a new project by doing the following in your commandline:

- `mkdir first-project`
- `cd first-project`
- `cabal init`

Open this folder in VSCode, and install the extension **ghcide** from the VSCode Marketplace. Done.

How can you know this all worked? You will be able to see definitions when hovering with your mouse, you can introduce an error and see it highlighted red in the code, and you will get autocompletion.

You add dependencies in `first-project.cabal`, and you can run the code by just typing `cabal run`. The thing that will be executed is always your `main :: IO ()` function.

The rest you will learn in the beginner's course. Have fun!


#### Some remarks about Cabal on Windows

**Note**: skip this if you just want to set up your Haskell tooling. This is more of an explanation why we did the setup the way described above.

The reason we are downloading a pre-compiled cabal 3 instead of doing the more canonical `cabal v2-install Cabal cabal-install` is because

- it works
- compiling from source takes a while
- the Cabal configuration on Windows currently needs some fixing.
- Cabal 2.4 doesn't have the flag `--install-method=copy`, so it can only try to symlink, which is not something Windows supports.

By default cabal currently produces the following config:

```
extra-include-dirs: C:\Program,
                    Files\Haskell,
                    Platform\8.6.5\mingw\include
extra-lib-dirs: C:\Program,Files\Haskell,Platform\8.6.5\mingw\lib
extra-prog-path: C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\8.6.5\msys\usr\bin,
                 C:\Users\jurichome\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin
```

Not only do the line breaks and commas make no sense, they also prevent Cabal from seeing MinGW and MSYS, leading to an error when trying to compile.

It can be assumed that this will be fixed in the future, and moreover **Haskell Platform** will probably ship with Cabal 3 directly some time in the future.



- `C:\Users\your-username-here\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin`
- `C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\8.6.5\lib\extralibs\bin`
- `cabal user-config update`

- Update **Cabal** (your tool for managing dependencies and building projects) to the latest version. Execute these in the commandline:
    - `cabal v2-update`.
    - **Before** you run the next step, you currently need to fix something in the Cabal configuration. Please follow the instructions [below](#Cabal-on-Windows-config-adjustment).
    - `cabal v2-install Cabal cabal-install`. Get a coffee while it compiles, or go make a new friend.
    - verify that you have version 3: `cabal --version`.
    - you can now create a new project folder with `cabal init` ðŸŽ‰
- Install 

#### Cabal on Windows config adjustment

Right now it's good to make some small adjustments to the Cabal config file.

Find out where it lives with `cabal user-config init` and open it in your editor of choice.

## Alternatives

- vim
- intero (?)
- repl.it
- stack instead of cabal
